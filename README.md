Dommy is command line application to run home automation scenarios.

Why this name ?
The name is a reference to the french comics "Travis".  In this serie there is an artificial inteligence for home automation.

Why this project ?
First I wanted to create automations with speech recongnition.

How it's works ?
I use :
- Kinect for speech recognicion.
- Microsoft Text to Speech for voice response.
- Eedomus API for home automation.
- Samsung TV API
- UsbUIRT controller for make infra red command.
